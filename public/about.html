<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a second year master's student in Applied Computer Science at Fairleigh Dickinson University with a background
  in Electrical Engineering. My academic journey has been focused on building scalable, user-friendly software solutions
  while applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning concepts to solve real-world challenges. I have developed
  practical skills in JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL, Python, SQL, and API development, and I am passionate about integrating
  these technologies to create impactful software products.
<p>Additionally, I have expertise in machine learning models, Pandas, NumPy, statistical analysis, probability theory, deep learning
   algorithms, Linux, algorithms and data structures, and debugging. My proficiency extends to Java, C, HTML, CSS, GitHub, and Visual
   Studio Code, along with both backend web technologies and frontend automation testing. I excel in team collaboration and communication
   to drive project success.</p>

<p>I have worked on several projects, including my capstone project, Astro Event Hub, where I designed and built a web-based platform for
   astronomy enthusiasts using the MERN stack. This project allowed me to enhance user engagement by implementing real-time communication
   features, ultimately boosting the system's performance by 30%.</p>
